* Linear classifier
    * y[i] = x[i]w[i] + b[i] 
    * Linear classifier is reasonably easy to understand and implement as this is the baisc idea which related to the math that we have learned from the middle school, simply put, it is the way to __map 2 different data set__, y and x, here y is the __output data__, x is the __input data__ which is the __features__ of the specific objects, __plus__ the so called "_weight and bias_" which are __w and b__, __weight__ represents importance of certain feature, and the bias is to
